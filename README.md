# Inshore-Ship-Detection-with-Sentinel1
Inshore ship detection is now big interest of harbor system monitoring or ship detection with satellite remotesensing systems. We used FBR Image(Frozen Background Reference Image) [1] and CFAR(Constant False Alarm Rate) algorithm to detect ships in inshore area with statistical method. And for deep learning we used CFAR-guided CNN [2] method with FBR image. In this tutorial, we combinde two methods mentiond before to make the better inshore ship detection result.
